# FILE FOR FUNCTION THAT CHECKS
# TO SEE IF THERE IS A WINNER, BASED
# ON THE CURRENT GAME STATE.
# ==================================

# Create a function that will check if there is a winner based
# on some test inputs.
# Example:
# input: [[X, X, X], [3, O, O], [6, X, O]]
# The function should look at this input and return if one of the sublists
# has all of the same value.
# Should return True, because the first sublist's values are all equal.
